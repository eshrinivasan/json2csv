There are comments in the simple-json2csv.js file on how this code works.

1. Just clone this repo, cd into the folder, do `npm install`
2. Run `node simple-json2csv.js`
3. A csv file will be generated in the same folder

Make changes to the createAListFromJson function in the simple-json2csv.js file if you need different output format.
Also remember to add the new input json file to this folder and change the references in the simple-json2csv file.
